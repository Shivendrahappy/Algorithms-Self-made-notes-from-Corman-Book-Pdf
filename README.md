Algorithms Self-made notes from the Cormen Book PDF
 WEEK 1 — Fundamentals and Data Structures
Day 1–2: Algorithm Basics
Read:


Chapter 1 — The Role of Algorithms in Computing


Chapter 2 — Getting Started (focus on Insertion Sort, Analysis of Algorithms)


Key Ideas:


Why algorithms matter


Time complexity & pseudocode structure


Understand O(n), O(log n), and O(n²) visually


Do in Python:


Write a simple insertion sort and measure runtime using the time module


Skip: Mathematical proofs



Day 3: Growth and Recursion
Read:


Chapter 3 — Growth of Functions


Chapter 4 — Divide and Conquer


Key Ideas:


How algorithm efficiency is compared


Concept of recursion and merge sort


Do in Python:


Implement merge_sort() recursively


Optional Visualization: Visualgo – Sorting



Day 4–5: Core Data Structures
Read:


Chapter 10 — Elementary Data Structures


Chapter 11 — Hash Tables


Chapter 12 — Binary Search Trees


Key Ideas:


Stack, Queue, Linked List, Hash Maps


Binary trees → basis of neural networks, memory representation


Do in Python:


Implement stack, queue, and dictionary manually


Write simple binary tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)


Skip: AVL trees and proofs



Day 6–7: Dynamic Programming (Essential for AI Planning)
Read:


Chapter 15 — Dynamic Programming


Key Ideas:


Breaking big problems into overlapping smaller subproblems


Used in reinforcement learning and empathy-based response optimization


Do in Python:


Fibonacci recursion vs DP version


Simple knapsack or path-finding problem


Skip: Matrix chain multiplication proofs



📅 WEEK 2 — Algorithms for AI-Style Thinking
Day 8–9: Sorting and Searching
Read:


Chapter 6 — Heapsort


Chapter 7 — Quicksort


Chapter 8 — Sorting in Linear Time (just overview)


Key Ideas:


Internal logic of sorting for structured data (used in model training pipelines)


Do in Python:


Implement quicksort recursively


Compare with Python’s built-in sorted() and measure runtime



Day 10–11: Graph Algorithms (For Neural/Empathy Networks)
Read:


Chapter 22 — Elementary Graph Algorithms


Chapter 23 — Minimum Spanning Trees (overview only)


Key Ideas:


How networks are represented mathematically


Connections between nodes mimic neural or emotional networks


Do in Python:


Represent simple graph as dictionary


Implement BFS and DFS traversal



Day 12–14: Revision + Practice + Notes
Make handwritten notes of key ideas in your notebook.


Summarize each algorithm in one sentence:


“What it solves,” “When to use,” “Efficiency.”


Create GitHub Readme Notes:


Title each section (Sorting, DP, Graphs, Data Structures)


Add 2–3 code examples under each


Use this as your research progress record



📚 Optional Books (Quick Reference)
“Algorithms Unlocked” by Cormen – an easier and shorter version of CLRS (~200 pages).


“Grokking Algorithms” by Aditya Bhargava – visual and fun, for reinforcement.


Python Algorithms by Magnus Lie Hetland – directly uses Python implementations.
